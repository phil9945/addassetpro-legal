    <h1>Privacy Policy – Add Asset Pro</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: 2025-11-11</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Add Asset Pro</strong> (the “App”) handles your information.
        The App is developed and published by <strong>Philip Mony</strong> (“I”, “me”, or “the developer”),
        based in British Columbia, Canada.
    </p>

    <p>By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <hr class="section-separator">

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Add Asset Pro is an offline utility app designed to help you capture and manage asset information
        using your device. The App stores data <strong>locally on your device</strong> and does
        <strong>not</strong> send your data to any external server controlled by the developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The App is supplied “as is”, without any warranties, guarantees, or official affiliation with any
        company or organization.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data the App May Handle</h2>
    <p>
        The App allows you to enter and store information such as (but not limited to):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Asset details (e.g., description, condition, purchase price, model/type, serial number, barcode)</li>
        <li>Session information (e.g., file prefixes, scan locations)</li>
        <li>
            Optional device-related context (if enabled in settings), such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Date last inventoried</li>
                <li>Device used (e.g., iPhone / iPad)</li>
                <li>Device user name</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information is entered or generated by you and is stored locally on your device in CSV and/or PDF files.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Location and GPS Data</h2>
    <p>
        If enabled in the configuration screen, the App may include the following in your CSV output:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Approximate latitude</li>
        <li>Approximate longitude</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These values are included only in the CSV files saved on your device and are used solely for your own
        asset tracking purposes. The App does <strong>not</strong> transmit this location data to the developer
        or any external server.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can turn GPS-related options on or off at any time in the configuration screen.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Local Storage Only</h2>
    <p>
        All asset data, configuration choices, and generated CSV/PDF files are stored locally on your device in
        the App’s document storage area.
    </p>
    <p>The App does not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>create an online account,</li>
        <li>upload your asset data to a remote server, or</li>
        <li>sync your data via a custom cloud service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any sharing of CSV/PDF files happens only when you choose to export or share them using standard iOS/iPadOS
        share options (e.g., Mail, Files, AirDrop, or third-party apps).
    </p>
    <p>
        Because the App does not use a developer-controlled server, <strong>you remain fully in control of your data</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Analytics, No Tracking, No Ads</h2>
    <p>
        Add Asset Pro:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>does <strong>not</strong> include third-party advertising SDKs,</li>
        <li>does <strong>not</strong> collect analytics or tracking identifiers, and</li>
        <li>does <strong>not</strong> use cookies or similar tracking technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The developer does not receive any information about how you use the App, other than what you may choose to
        share directly (for example, by emailing a question or support request).
    </p>

    <h2>6. How You Can Manage or Delete Your Data</h2>
    <p>
        Because all data is stored locally on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete individual CSV/PDF files from the “Saved Sessions” area or from the Files app (if exported there).</li>
        <li>You can clear session data using the in-app options.</li>
        <li>You can delete the App from your device at any time, which will also remove the App’s local data stored in its container on that device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you have exported files (for example, to iCloud Drive, local Files, email, or other apps), those copies
        must be deleted manually from those locations.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Add Asset Pro is a general-purpose utility application and is not specifically directed at children. The App
        does not knowingly collect personal information from children. All data is entered and controlled by the user
        of the device.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App relies on Apple’s iOS/iPadOS frameworks (such as camera, filesystem, and location services where enabled)
        to function. These components are provided by Apple and are governed by Apple’s own privacy policies and terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        The developer does not integrate separate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>
        Because your data is stored locally on your device, its security depends largely on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>your device’s operating system (iOS/iPadOS), and</li>
        <li>any security features you enable, such as device passcode, Face ID / Touch ID, and encrypted backups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The App does not implement its own encryption layer on top of what the operating system provides.
    </p>

    <h2>10. International Users</h2>
    <p>
        The App is developed and published in British Columbia, Canada. Regardless of where you are located, the App
        does not transmit your asset data to a developer-controlled server. Any files you export or share may be stored
        by services you choose (such as iCloud, email providers, or cloud storage), which are governed by their own
        privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the App’s functionality or in
        applicable laws or regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the Policy is updated, the “Last updated” date at the top will be revised. Continued use of the App after
        changes are published will constitute your acceptance of the updated Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how the App handles data, please use the contact
        information provided on the App Store listing for Add Asset Pro to reach the developer, <strong>Philip Mony</strong>.
